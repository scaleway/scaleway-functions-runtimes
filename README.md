# Core Runtime for Scaleway Functions

This repository contains the core runtime used inside `Scaleway Functions`'s platform, built with `Golang`, as well as [language specific sub-runtimes](./runtimes).

This runtime is the Gateway to functions running in Scaleway's Cloud. Its goal is to provide a set of features optimized for `Function As A Service` technologies, and make it easy for users to run their applications in the cloud.

A `runtime` on Scaleway Serverless Platform is made of 2 components:
- Core Runtime written in Golang: Starts a HTTP server, handles incoming request, transforms data into event objects, handles authentication (users can deploy private functions), starts a sub-runtime and proxy request to the sub-runtime
- Sub-Runtime (Language specific code), Starts a HTTP server, receives requests from Core-Runtime containing "event", "context" and user's handler informations (handler file and exported function to execute). The sub-runtime is a bridge between the core-runtime and the user's code. We can not dynamically import and execute node.js code in Golang, so we have to create a bridge in node.js to handle this logic.

We decided to split the logic in 2 components because we wanted to handle the common logic (transforming HTTP requests in event/context, handling authentication...) in one place, instead of maintaining 5 different repositories (at this time), all doing the same logic. It makes it easier for us to maintain our runtimes, as sub-runtimes have a minimal task to fulfill: import and invoke user's code.

## Features

- Simple HTTP Webserver
- Manages Authentication (On Scaleway Serverless Platform, users can choose to deploy their functions `privately` and they will have to provide a valid JWT generated by our APIs to trigger the function, [see the official documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/serverless/api/#authentication)
- Handles incoming requests, transforms data into events (and execution context of the function)
- Dynamically import and execute functions handlers, provided by end-users.
- Manages Handler's responses based on trigger-type (for example, HTTP requires function handlers to return an HTTP response while CRON jobs do not require any of it).

**At the moment, we only support the following runtimes** ([see the corresponsing sub-runtimes](./runtimes)):
- Node.js version 8 and version 10
- Python version 2.7 and version 3.7
- Golang version 1.11+

## How to use this runtime

You can use this runtime on your own infrastructure, or on your local environment if you wish to contribute to its development.

### Introduction

In order to create a new runtime extending Scaleway's Core runtime, for example `ruby` or `dotnet`, you will have to respect certain criterias:
- Your runtime should create an HTTP server, listening on given `$SCW_UPSTREAM_PORT` environment variable, on interface `127.0.0.1` (As both core-runtime and your sub-runtime will run in the same docker container, core-runtime will proxy requests to local network interface).
- Listen for traffic on endpoint `POST /` (e.g. `POST 127.0.0.1:$SCW_UPSTREAM_PORT`)
- Manage incoming requests, with the following structure:
  - `event`: Data for the event that triggered the function execution (in case of an HTTP request, it contains the request body, incoming headers, query parameters...)
  - `context`: Execution context of your function
  - `handlerPath`: Path to your Handler file (e.g. for handler located in `/home/app/function/handler.js`: `/home/app/function/handler`), you will have to handle dynamic import of your handler file (if dynamic language)
  - `handlerName`: Name of the exported function to use as a handler (e.g. `/home/app/function/handler.js`: module.exports.handle = ..., `handlerName` is `handle`).
  Full Example of request body for an function invoked via HTTP Trigger:
      ```json
      {
        "event": {
            "body": {...request body},
            "headers": {...request headers},
            "httpMethod": "POST",
            "path": "/test",
            "pathParameters": {},
            "queryStringParameters": {
                "query": "value"
            },
            "multiValueHeaders": null,
            "multiValueQueryStringParameters": null,
            "stageVariables": null,
            "isBase64Encoded": false,
            "requestContext": {
                "eventType": "http",
                "httpMethod": "POST",
                "path": "/test",
                "stage": "dev",
            },
            "resource": "http"
        },
        "context": {
            "functionName": "myFunction",
            "memoryInMb": 128
        },
        "handlerPath": "/home/app/function/handler",
        "handlerName": "handle"
      }
      ```
- Send an HTTP response with the following structure (for HTTP Triggers):
  - `body`: Response body
  - `statusCode`: Status Code for HTTP Response to the client invoking the function
  - `headers`: Map of headers (key: value) to send in HTTP Response
  Example of Response from custom runtimes (invoked via HTTP Trigger):
      ```json
      {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": {
            "key": "value"
        },
        "headers": {
            "key": "value"
        }
      }
      ```

### Requirements

To start using Scaleway's `core-runtime`, you'll need to go through multiple steps:
- Install Golang (version >= 1.11 as we are using `go mod` for our dependencies)
- Download this repository (outside of your `$GOPATH` as we are using go mod).
- Pre-requisites related to your custom runtime (for example, to run node.js runtime, you need to install node.js)

### Specific Instructions for Dynamic Languages

In order to create a custom runtime extending this `core-runtime` with a dynamic language (such as Python, Node.js or Ruby for example), you will have to develop a sub-runtime script, in charge of:
- Starting an HTTP Server on port `$SCW_UPSTREAM_PORT` (provided via environment variable) on host `$SCW_UPSTREAM_HOST` (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8081` is the default for core-runtime's sub runtimes), handling `POST` requests on `/`.
- Dynamically import function handler from given `handlerPath` and `handlerName` (see part `How to use this runtime` above).
- Handle potential errors (while importing handler), and during handler execution, to format the error response properly (this may be useful, to provide good feedbacks on errors to your users).
- Send Back an HTTP response with handler's return result.

You may find [examples of Node and Python custom runtimes](./runtimes) (developped and maintained by Scaleway, used on Scaleway Functions platform).

In order to configure `core-runtime` to use your "Language Specific Runtime", you will have to set different environment variables:

| variable name | description |
|----------|-------------|
| SCW_HANDLER_NAME |  Exported function to use as a handler (e.g. `handl` for a node.js function with a `module.exports.handke` handler) |
| SCW_HANDLER_PATH | Absolute path to your handler file (e.g. `/home/app/function/handler` or `/home/app/function/handler.js`) |
| SCW_RUNTIME_BINARY | Absolute path to the binary of the language you wish to use to execute your runtime (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/node` or `/usr/local/bin/python`) |
| SCW_RUNTIME_BRIDGE | Absolute Path to your custom-runtime entrypoint (e.g. `/home/app/myruntime.js`) |

This Core-runtime will take care of executing `$SCW_RUNTIME_BINARY $SCW_RUNTIME_BRIDGE` (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/node /home/app/myruntime.js`) to start the sub-runtime HTTP server.

When the Core-runtime receives an HTTP request, it will transform it into a usable `event structure`, create the `context object`, and execute your sub-runtime code by sending an HTTP request to its HTTP server.

#### Example

- I have a Node.js handler ([see this example](./examples/node/handler.js)) (located in `/home/app/function/handler.js`) with our [custom runtime defined here](./runtimes/node10) (located in `/home/app/index.js`).
- I configure my environment properly:
    ```bash
    export SCW_RUNTIME_BINARY=/usr/local/bin/node
    export SCW_RUNTIME_BRIDGE=/home/app/index.js
    export SCW_HANDLER_PATH=/home/app/function/handler
    export SCW_HANDLER_NAME=handle
    export SCW_UPSTREAM_HOST=127.0.0.1
    export SCW_UPSTREAM_PORT=8081
    # PORT used by core runtime to serve HTTP server
    export PORT=8080
    # For this example, we're setting function's authentication privacy to public
    export SCW_PUBLIC=true
    ```
- I can run my [core-runtime](./main.go):
  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```
- I can trigger my function:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8080
  ```

### Specific Instructions for compiled languages

In order to create a custom runtime extending this `core-runtime` with a compiled language (such as Golang, C# for example), you will most likely have to develop a custom `Library` that will wrap your function handler's code with the necessary logic described above.

As the Function Handler's code is compiled as a binary, you will have to include the runtime logic (creating server, handling incoming traffic and outgoing responses...) alonside your handler code.

You may find an [example of a Golang custom runtime here](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-functions-go) (developed and maintained by Scaleway and running on Scaleway Serverless platform).

In order to configure `core-runtime` to use your handler as a Binary (compiled code), you will have to set different environment variables:
- `SCW_HANDLER_IS_BINARY=true` this is important, as the core-runtime will initialize your runtime by running a command (for example `/home/app/function/handler` if you compiled your dotnet program into a `handler` binary).
- `SCW_HANDLER_PATH=absolute/path/to/binary` (for example `/home/app/function/handler` if you compiled your program into a `handler` binary)

#### Example

In this example, we are using the [official Golang sub-runtime for Serverless Scaleway](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-functions-go).

- I have a Golang Handler in a file `main.go` using my custom runtime [described in this sample](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-functions-go/blob/master/example/main.go)
- I build a `handler` binary and output it to `/home/app/function` directory:
  ```bash
  go build -o /home/app/function/handler main.go
  ```
- I configure my environment properly:
    ```bash
    export SCW_HANDLER_PATH=/home/app/function/handler
    export SCW_HANDLER_IS_BINARY=true
    export SCW_UPSTREAM_PORT=8081
    # PORT used by core runtime to serve HTTP server
    export PORT=8080
    # For this example, we're setting function's authentication privacy to public
    export SCW_PUBLIC=true
    ```
- I can run my [core-runtime binary](./main.go):
  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```
- I can trigger my function:
  ```bash
  curl localhost:8080
  ```
